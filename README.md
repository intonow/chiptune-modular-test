# chiptune-modular-test
trying to make a modular and easy chiptune player

the end goal would be to have a simple tracker / chiptune player that "just works", and that could be added easily to other players like mpv or mpd


# files that will be supported
- mod (support a lot of systems)
- nsf (nes/famicom)
- psf/minipsf (playstation)
- (playstation 2)
- 2sf/mini2sf (nds)
- (gba)
- (gameboy)

- xm / it ? (usually already supported so idk)
